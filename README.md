# Cat And Dog Image Classifier
This repository uses Python and the TensorFlow framework to create a convolutional neural network model that can classify images of dogs and cats. The project was completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) [Machine Learning with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/).

# **Acknowledgments**
#
* I'd like to thank [Dominic LaBella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiclabella/), my instructor at the Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp I attended, for planting a seed in my brain that was the start of my computer programming knowledge and understanding. I work hard every day to grow that seed. None of this would be possible for me if not for his passion for teaching and deep understanding of these subjects.
